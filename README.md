# PlantSci_BigData

This repository contains the workshop materials used in the 2020 UF Plant Science Symposium on Big Data.


## Workshop description
Decades of genomic data collection have resulted in robust software tools, methodologies, and analysis pipelines to and interpret large datasets, resulting in scientific discoveries (cloned genes, QTL, genetic markers, etc.). The rapid upsurge in sensor based phenomic technologies and broad scientific adoption has led to a demand for open-source data processing pipelines and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable) metadata. To date, most open-source image processing pipelines are custom scripts unique to each research objective. In this workshop we will discuss approaches to developing a data extraction pipeline for plant height from UAS image-based point clouds of maize.

 

Topics will cover ground control points, UAS image collection, image processing, data extraction, and application of UAS phenotypes within areas of statistical modeling and genetic mapping. The focus of the workshop will be to walk through how one may critically identify and combine the  necessary processing steps within their own pipeline, past the image processing stage, to extract your phenotypes of interest. Having hands on experience extracting the meaningful information from a large dataset will give participants skills necessary to develop their own pipelines, create publicly available processing tools, and provide FAIR data to the research community.
